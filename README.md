generic_javascript
==================

This is collection of helper functions, controls, and composite controls that are all based on the Google Closure framework.

All are:

Following the style guildlines for Google Closure

Checked against the Google Closure linter

Compiled with the Google Closure compiler

Test first

Built on heavy use of method injection, and functional (Wishful Thinking) design

Built to be used with any web framework that supports ajax


Examples are in another repository: https://github.com/byatool/testboard . The examples use the .Net MVC4 framework, but can be used with any framework. The goal is to make web framework agnostic JavaScript components.
